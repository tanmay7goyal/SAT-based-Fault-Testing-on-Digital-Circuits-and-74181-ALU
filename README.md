# SAT-based-Fault-Testing-on-Digital-Circuits-and-74181-ALU
Formulated CNFs for good and faulty circuits; modeled stuck-at faults using SAT solvers. Applied SAT-based Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) to the 74181 ALU, producing test vectors for single and multiple stuck-at faults to enhance fault coverage.
